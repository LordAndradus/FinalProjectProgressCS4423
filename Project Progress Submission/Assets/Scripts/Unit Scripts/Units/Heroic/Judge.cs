/* Backstory: Long-time friend to the general; Served as squad-mates while the empire was still alive.
 * A special class Judge - Single unit squad only! No cost, very powerful. Final class form "Arbiter"
 * Enemy squad CANNOT retaliate
 * Look: Armor clad in black with a gold trim and appropriate cloth accesories (IE Cloak and etc), holds a book as a weapon
 * Attack animation: He will take out his book and pop a text bubble "Though art judged", with some visual and actual effects based enemy faction
 * Retaliation animation: throws magic missles at all enemy units with 100% chance to hit. The damage is equal to twice his magic stat
